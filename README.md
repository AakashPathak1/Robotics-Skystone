# Robotics-Skystone

## This repo contains a subset of the code written for Team 8872's competitive season from 2019-2020.

## Main objectives: 
  * autonomously drive the robot using external encoders controlled and monitored by a [PID loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#:~:text=A%20proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative%20controller,continuously%20calculates%20an%20error%20value).
  * We used 3 encoders onboard the robot to create an [odometry system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry).
  * automatically stop the robot at specific places on the playing field using color sensors that monitor the color of the tiles the robot drives on.
  * drive the robot using a Logitech gaming controller and a human. 
  
## Videos of the robot in action:

### The robot is completely autonomously driven in the video below. It's tasks are:
* to find a yellow block with black tape on it, pick it up and transport it to the other side
* return and find the second yellow block with black tape on it, and transport it to the other side
* move the red platform 
* and park in the center of the field
